## In camera bracketing  with R7

Recent cameras such as the Canon R7 have fetures to allow Foocus bracketing. The advantage is that no specialized equipment is needed, but a tripod so the image is more stable. 
Some tutorials that show how to do this are available on youtube, by various youtubers. I liked the vide from Fabian Foop as it explains how to do it and also identifies how to set the camera up easily.
